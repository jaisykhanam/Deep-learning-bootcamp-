🧠 Introduction

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to learn from data.
It powers applications like:
	•	Image recognition 🖼️
	•	Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🗣️
	•	Self-driving cars 🚗
	•	Recommendation systems 🎬

This guide will help you learn systematically.
